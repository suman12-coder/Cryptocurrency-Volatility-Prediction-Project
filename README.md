# Cryptocurrency Volatility Prediction

# Overview
This project aims to predict **next-day cryptocurrency price volatility** using historical market data such as opening price, closing price, trading volume, and market capitalization.  
A **Random Forest Regression model** was trained and tuned to forecast volatility, and the final model was deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web app**.
